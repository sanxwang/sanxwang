- 👋 Hi there! I'm @sanxwang, a web frontend developer with a passion for creating visually stunning experiences. 
- 👀 I'm fascinated by VR, 3D graphics (Three.js), and silky smooth animations. I love breathing life into user interfaces through motion and interaction.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning more about WebGL, WebVR, and optimizations for high FPS animation. There's always more to explore!
- 🎨 In my spare time I like to experiment with Three.js frameworks and tweak graphics settings to push boundaries. Bring on the particles!
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on projects that involve crafting immersive environments and trippy visual effects. Let's make something weird and wonderful!
- 📫 Want to chat? Reach me at sanxwang@outlook.com. I'd love to connect with other devs interested in 3D, VR, and animation!
